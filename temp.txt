Learn Vector Databases the Practical Way!

I just built a Mini RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system over PDFs using Python and a vector database — and you can too!

What you'll learn by building it:
• Chunking documents and generating embeddings with sentence-transformers
• Storing and querying vectors with ChromaDB (local vector DB)
• Hybrid search (BM25 + semantic search) for better results
• Creating a FastAPI backend with /search and /ask endpoints
• Preparing for production by swapping ChromaDB → Qdrant or other vector DBs

Stack:
Python, FastAPI, ChromaDB, Sentence-Transformers, BM25

Why this project?
Instead of just reading about vector databases, you'll build something that takes real PDFs, finds the most relevant chunks, and can be extended into a full RAG pipeline with an LLM.

If you've been curious about vector search, semantic search, or RAG, this project will give you hands-on skills in under a weekend!
